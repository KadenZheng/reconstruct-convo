Increasing minimum wage will lead to an increase in prices of goods and services offered by companies. The increased prices will result in less demand for those goods and services.

Even if a company automates some of its jobs, it will still need human workers to maintain and supervise the automated processes. The skills required for these jobs may be higher than those required for the automated jobs. So, workers will still benefit from minimum wage increase.\n\n3.
