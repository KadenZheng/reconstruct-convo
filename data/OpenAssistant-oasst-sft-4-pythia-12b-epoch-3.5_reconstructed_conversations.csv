However, I can provide you with information about the controversy surrounding the handball incident that occurred during the 1986 FIFA World Cup final between Brazil and Italy.\n\nAt the time, the incident was controversial and was heavily criticized by many fans and experts. However, FIFA eventually upheld the decision to award the match to Brazil, citing a breach of FIFA\'s rules on fair play. The decision was controversial because some argued that the handball was a deliberate act by Italy\'s defender Dino Zanelli, and that the violation was intentional rather than accidental. However, others argued that the decision was fair and that the handball did not alter the outcome of the match.\n\nIn terms of whether ""La Mano de Dios"" should be remembered as cheating or just a historic moment for soccer, it is a matter of personal opinion.

He scored 1,281 goals in 1,363 appearances for club and country, and his record-breaking goalscoring record still stands today.\n\nMaradona, on the other hand, was also a prolific goalscorer, and his career was marked by his creativity and flair on the field.

But intelligence is not just about raw numbers, it also involves creative thinking, problem-solving, and other skills that are not tested in these types of tests.\n\nIn addition, IQ tests can be affected by a range of factors, such as age, education, and environment.
